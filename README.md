# Privacy-eye
Privacy Eye is a browser extension that identifies any trackers used by a website and shows the number and duration of hidden 3rd party cookies - aka "Anatomy of the Internet". It does not block website trafic, or store any user data. The main purpose is to improve internet transparency and raise privacy awareness for non-tech users. 
We published it at Chrome WebStore so people can use it right away. No prerequsites needed. Simply download it to your Chrome browser, then you are ready to rock! [Download it for free!](https://inpooling.com/blog/privacy-eye-free-and-open-source-browser-extension-for-data-privacy/)
