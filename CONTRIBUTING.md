# How to contribute?
Welcome dear contributor! As we created this tool for free use and we have very limited financial ressources, current version of tool is quite simple. There are many ways that you can contribute. 

Here is a quick orientation to guide your adventure:
1. Use the tool and spread the word to your family and friends.
2. Report issues
3. Suggest and Add new features to the tool
4. Security vulnerabilities can be reported privately to Dan+support@inpooling.com

If you find something confusing or frustrating, please let us know! We believe in making Privacy Eye better by making it easier for you to contribute.


# Sumbitting changes

Please send a [GitHub Pull Request to PrivacyEye](https://github.com/Dan-inpooling/Privacy-eye/pulls) with a clear list of what you've done (read more about [pull requests](http://help.github.com/pull-requests/)). When you send a pull request, we will love you forever if you include RSpec examples. We can always use more test coverage. Please make sure all of your commits are atomic (one feature per commit).

Always write a clear log message for your commits. One-line messages are fine for small changes, but bigger changes should look like this:

    $ git commit -m "A brief summary of the commit
    > 
    > A paragraph describing what changed and its impact."
    
Thank you!
